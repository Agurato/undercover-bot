# undercover-bot
Discord bot for the undercover game

Inspired from [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2) and [http://www.monabgames.com/undercover/](http://www.monabgames.com/undercover/)

ðŸ¥¥In a nutshell:
â€¢ Each player receives a secret word
â€¢ The "Civilians" all receive the same word (e.g. "tiger")
â€¢ The "Undercover" receives a slightly different word (e.g. "lion")
â€¢ "Mr.White" receives no word at all
â€¢ The goal is to guess other people's identities based on their descriptions of their word

THE GAME
Aim of the game is to find out who are playing undercover among the citizens.

HOW TO PLAY
Citizens will be assigned the same word and undercovers will be assigned a word similar to the ones citizens have.
Each round, players must give a word or phrase as a clue to what their word is. After every round, players can collectively decide if they want to guess the undercover and reveal a player's identity, or continue playing the next round without revealing anyone's identity.
There will be an option to add Mr. White who will be assigned no word.
