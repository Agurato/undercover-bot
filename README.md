# undercover-bot
Discord bot for the Undercover^^ game

Inspired from [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2)


THIS IS STILL AN ONGOING PROJECT. IT IS NOT FUNCTIONAL.

## In a nutshell

- Each player receives a secret word
- The "Civilians" all receive the same word (e.g. "tiger")
- The "Undercover" receives a slightly different word (e.g. "lion")
- "Mr.White" receives no word at all
- The goal is to guess other people's identities based on their descriptions of their word
