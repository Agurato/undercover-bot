# undercover-bot
Discord bot for the Undercover^^ game

Inspired from [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/undercover-2) and [http://www.monabgames.com/undercover/](http://www.monabgames.com/undercover/)

## In a nutshell

- Each player receives a secret word
- The "Civilians" all receive the same word (e.g. "tiger")
- The "Undercover" receives a slightly different word (e.g. "lion")
- "Mr.White" receives no word at all
- The goal is to guess other people's identities based on their descriptions of their word

## THE GAME

Aim of the game is to find out who are playing undercover among the citizens.

## HOW TO PLAY

Citizens will be assigned the same word and undercovers will be assigned a word similar to the ones citizens have.
Each round, players must give a word or phrase as a clue to what their word is. After every round, players can collectively decide if they want to guess the undercover and reveal a player's identity, or continue playing the next round without revealing anyone's identity.
There will be an option to add Mr. White who will be assigned no word.
